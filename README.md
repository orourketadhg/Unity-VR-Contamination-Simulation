# Virtual Reality Contamination Simulation

With growing concern for viruses rising among the general population, methods to demonstrate
the effects transmission are needed. This project attempts to show the potential use
of extended reality for the education and research of viruses. Specifically, it investigates
whether extended reality hardware can provide a base for the simulation of viruses.

To test this hypothesis, a proof of concept project to simulate viruses and viral transmission
in virtual reality has been created. This simulation attempts to demonstrate the process
of virus emission, spread, and transmission, as well as some precautions that can be taken
to minimise the effects of transmission. To simulate virus particles, the project utilised the
Unity game engineâ€™s approach to data-oriented design game development, the Data-Oriented
Technology Stack. The results confirmed that it is possible to use XR technology to create
such a simulation, however some technical limitations may apply.

The resulting simulation suggests that it is possible can be used XR technology to
create simulations for education. However, with the current level of XR hardware and XR
development suites, using performance first programming practices should be taken into
consideration for projects development.
